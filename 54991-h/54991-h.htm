<h4>Preface: Bibliographical.</h4>


<p>1. The text I have used for the following translations is that of the
edition of the complete works of Pushkin in ten volumes, 16mo., by
Suvorin, St. Petersburg, 1887. The poems form Volumes III. and IV.
of that edition. Accordingly, I have designated after each heading,
volume, and page where the poem is to be found in the original. Thus,
for example, "My Muse, IV. 1," means that this poem is found in Volume
IV. of the above edition, page 1.</p>

<p>2. I have translated Pushkin literally word for word, line for line. I
do not believe there are as many as five examples of deviation from the
literalness of the text. Once only, I believe, have I transposed two
lines for convenience of translation; the other deviations are (<i>if</i>
they are such) a substitution of an <i>and</i> for a comma in order to make
now and then the reading of a line musical. With these exceptions, I
have sacrified <i>everything</i> to faithfulness of rendering. My object was
to make Pushkin himself, without a prompter, speak to English readers.
To make him thus speak in a foreign tongue was indeed to place him
at a disadvantage; and music and rhythm and harmony are indeed fine
things, but truth is finer still. I wished to present not what Pushkin
would have said, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> should have said, if he had written in English,
but what he does say in Russian. That, stripped from all ornament of
his wonderful melody and grace of form, as he is in a translation, he
still, even in the hard English tongue, soothes and stirs, is in itself
a sign that through the individual soul of Pushkin sings that universal
soul whose strains appeal forever to man, in whatever clime, under
whatever sky.</p>

<p>3. I ask, therefore, no forgiveness, no indulgence even, from the
reader for the crudeness and even harshness of the translation,
which, I dare say, will be found in abundance by those who <i>look</i> for
something to blame. Nothing of the kind is necessary. I have done the
only thing there was to be done. Nothing more <i>could</i> be done (I mean
by me, of course), and if critics still demand more, they must settle
it not with me, but with the Lord Almighty, who in his grim, yet arch
way, long before critics appeared on the stage, hath ordained that it
shall be impossible for a thing to be and not to be at the same time.</p>

<p>4. I have therefore tried neither for measure nor for rhyme. What I
have done was this: I first translated each line word for word, and
then by reading it aloud let mine ear arrange for me the words in such
a way as to make some kind of rhythm. Where this could be done, I was
indeed glad; where this could not be done, I was not sorry. It is idle
to regret the impossible.</p>

<p>5. That the reader, however, may see for himself what he has been
spared by my abstinence from attempting the impossible, I give
one stanza of a metrical translation by the side of the literal
rendering:&mdash;</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">LITERAL:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
The moment wondrous I remember<br />
Thou before me didst appear,<br />
Like a flashing apparition,<br />
Like a spirit of beauty pure.<br />
</p>

<p style="font-size: 0.8em;">METRICAL:<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
Yes! I remember well our meeting,<br />
When first thou dawnedst on my sight,<br />
Like some fair phantom past me fleeting,<br />
Some nymph of purity and light.<br />
</p>

<p>Observe, Pushkin the real does not appear before the reader with a
solemn affirmation, Yes, or No, nor that he remembers it <i>well</i>. He
tells the story in such a way that the reader knows without being told
that he does indeed remember it well! Nor does he weaken the effect by
saying that he remembers the <i>meeting</i>, which is too extended, but the
<i>moment</i>, which is concentrated. And Pushkin's imagination was moreover
too pure to let a <i>fleeting</i> phantom <i>dawn</i> upon his sight. To have
tried for a rendering which necessitated from its very limitations
<i>such</i> falsities, would have been not only to libel poor Pushkin, but
also to give the reader poor poetry besides.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Blackwood's Magazine, lviii. 35, July, 1845.</p></div>

<p>6. The translation being literal, I have been able to retain even the
punctuation of Pushkin, and especially his dots, of which he makes
such frequent use. They are part of his art; they express by what
they withhold. I call especial attention to these, as Pushkin is as
powerful in what he indicates as in what he shows, in what he suggests
as in what he actually says. The finest example of the highest poetry
of his <i>silence</i> (indicated by his dots) is the poem I have entitled
"Jealousy," to which the reader is particularly requested to turn with
this commentary of mine (p. 114). The poet is melted with tenderness at
the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> thought of his beloved all alone, far-off, weeping. The fiendish
doubt suddenly overpowers him, that after all, perhaps his beloved is
at that moment not alone, weeping for him, but in the arms of another:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
Alone ... to lips of none she is yielding<br />
Her shoulders, nor moist lips, nor snow-white fingers.<br />
<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span><br />
None is worthy of her heavenly love.<br />
Is it not so? Thou art alone<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span> Thou weepest<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span><br />
And I at peace?<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span><br />
<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span><br />
But if<span style="font-size: 1.5em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.</span><br />
</p>

<p>One must be all vibration in order to appreciate the matchless power of
the dots here. The poem here ends. I know not the like of this in all
literature.</p>

<p>7. Wherever I could ascertain the date of a poem, I have placed it at
the end. The reader will thus at a glance find at least one of the
proper relations of the poems to the poet's soul. For this purpose
these two dates should be borne constantly in mind: Pushkin was born in
1799; he died in 1837.</p>

<p>8. To many of his poems Pushkin has given no name. To such, for the
reader's convenience I have supplied names, but have put them in
brackets, which accordingly are to be taken as indication that the name
they enclose is not Pushkin's. Many of his most beautiful poems were
addressed to individuals, and they appear in the original as "Lines
to &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;." The gem of this collection, for instance, to which I have
supplied the title, "Inspiring Love"&mdash;inadequate enough, alas!&mdash;appears
in the original as "To A. P. Kern." As none of these poems have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> any
<i>intrinsic</i> bond with the personages addressed, their very greatness
lying in their universality, I have supplied my own titles to such
pieces, giving the original title in a note.</p>

<p>9. It was my original intention to make a life of the poet part of this
volume. But so varied was Pushkin's life, and so instructive withal,
that only an extended account could be of value. What is worth doing at
all is worth doing well. A mere sketch would here, for various reasons,
be worse than useless. Critics, who always know better what an author
ought to do than he himself, must kindly take this assertion of mine,
for the present at least, on trust, and assume that I, who have done
some thinking on the subject, am likely to know whereof I speak better
than those whose only claim to an opinion is that they have done no
thinking on the subject, resembling in this respect our modest friends,
the agnostics, who set themselves up as the true, knowing solvers of
the problems of life, because, forsooth, they know nothing.... Anyhow,
even at the risk of offending critics, I have decided to misstate
myself by not giving the life of Pushkin rather than to misstate poor
Pushkin by giving an attenuated, vapid thing, which passes under
the name of a "Sketch." The world judges a man by what is known of
him, forgetting that underneath the thin film of the known lies the
immeasurable abyss of the unknown, and that the true explanation of the
man is found not in what is visible of him, but in what is invisible
of him. Unless, therefore, I could present what is known of Pushkin
in such a manner as to suggest the unknown (just as a study of nature
should only help us to trust that what we do <i>not</i> know of God is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
likewise good!) I have no business to tell of his life. But to tell of
it in such a way that it shall represent Pushkin, and not misrepresent
him, is possible only in an extended life. Otherwise, I should be
telling not how he was living, but how he was starving, dying; and this
is not an edifying task, either for the writer or for the reader.</p>

<p>10. Such a life is now well-nigh writ, but it is too long to make part
of this volume.</p>

<h4>Introduction: Critical</h4>

<h5>I. POETIC IDEAL.</h5>


<p>1. Pushkin was emphatically a subjective writer. Of intense
sensibility, which is <i>the</i> indispensable condition of creative
genius, he was first of all a feeler with an Æolian attachment. He
did not even have to take the trouble of looking into his heart in
order to write. So full of feeling was his heart that at the slightest
vibration it poured itself out; and so deep was its feeling that what
is poured out is already melted, fused, shaped, and his poems come
forth, like Minerva from Jupiter's head, fully armed. There is a
perfection about them which is self-attesting in its unstudiedness and
artlessness; it is the perfection of the child, touching the hearts of
its beholders all the more tenderly because of its unconsciousness,
effortlessness; it is the perfection which Jesus had in mind when he
uttered that sentence so profound and so little followed because of
its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> very profundity: "Unless ye be like little children." So calm and
poiseful is Pushkin's poetry that in spite of all his pathos his soul
is a work of architecture,&mdash;a piece of frozen music in the highest
sense. Even through his bitterest agony,&mdash;and pathos is the one chord
which is never absent from Pushkin's song, as it is ever present in
Chopin's strains, ay, as it ever must be present in any soul that
truly <i>lives,</i>&mdash;there runneth a peace, a simplicity which makes the
reader exclaim on reading him: Why, I could have done the self-same
thing myself,&mdash;an observation which is made at the sight of Raphael's
Madonna, at the oratory of a Phillips, at the reading of "The Vicar of
Wakefield," at the acting of a Booth. Such art is of the highest, and
is reached only through one road: Spontaneity, complete abandonment
of self. The verse I have to think over I had better not write. Man
is to become only a pipe through which the Spirit shall flow; and the
Spirit <i>shall</i> flow only where the resistance is least. Ope the door,
and the god shall enter! Seek not, pray not! To pray is to will, and to
will is to obstruct. The virtue which Emerson praises so highly in a
pipe&mdash;that it is smooth and hollow&mdash;is the very virtue which makes him
like Nature, an ever open, yet ever sealed book.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> Bring to him <i>your</i>
theories, <i>your</i> preconceived notions, and Emerson, like the great soul
of which he is but a voice, becomes unintelligible, confusing, chaotic.
The words are there; the eyes see them. The dictionary is at hand,
but nought avails; of understanding there is none to be had. But once
abandon will, once abandon self, once abandon opinion (a much harder
abandonment this than either!), and Emerson is made of glass, just as
when I abandon <i>my</i> logic, God becomes transparent enough.... And what
is true of Emerson is true of every great soul.</p>

<p>2. The highest art then is artlessness, unconsciousness. The true
artist is not the conceiver, the designer, the executor, but the
tool, the recorder, the reporter. He writes because write he must,
just as he breathes because breathe he must. And here too, Nature, as
elsewhere, hath indicated the true method. The most vital processes of
life are not the voluntary, the conscious, but the involuntary, the
unconscious. The blood circulates, the heart beats, the lungs fill,
the nerves vibrate; we digest, we fall asleep, we are stirred with
love, with awe, with reverence, without our will; and our highest
aspirations, our sweetest memories, our cheerfullest hopes, and alas!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
also our bitterest self-reproaches, come ever like friends at the
feast,&mdash;uninvited. You can be happy, blest at will? Believe it not!
Happiness, blessedness <i>willed</i> is not to be had in the market at any
quotation. It is not to be got. It comes. And it comes when least
willed. He is truly rich who has nought left to be deprived of, nought
left to ask for, nought left to will....</p>

<p>3. Pushkin, therefore, was incapable of giving an account of his own
poetry. Pushkin could not have given a theory of a single poem of his,
as Poe has given of his "Raven." Poe's account of the birth of "The
Raven" is indeed most delightful reading. "I told you so," is not
so much the voice of conceit, of "I knew better than thou!" but the
voice of the epicurean in us; it is ever a delight to most of us to
discover after the event that we knew it all before.... Delightful,
then, it is indeed, to read Poe's theory of his own "Raven;" but its
most delightful part is that the theory is a greater fiction than
the poem itself. It is the poem that has created the theory, not the
theory the poem. Neither could Pushkin do what Schiller has done: give
a theory of a drama of his own. The theory of Don Karlos as developed
in Schiller's letters on that play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> are writ not by Friedrich Schiller
the poet, the darling of the German land, the inspirer of the youth of
all lands, but by Herr von Schiller the professor; by Von Schiller the
Kantian metaphysician; by Von Schiller the critic; by another Schiller,
in short. Pushkin, however, unlike most of us, was not half a dozen
ancestors&mdash;God, beast, sage, fool&mdash;rolled into one, each for a time
claiming him as his own. Pushkin was essentially a unit, one voice; he
was a lyre, on which a <i>something, not he</i>&mdash;God!&mdash;invisibly played.</p>

<p>4. And this he unconsciously to himself expresses in the piece, "My
Muse."</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"From mom till night in oak's dumb shadow<br />
To the strange maid's teaching intent I listened;<br />
And with sparing reward me gladdening,<br />
Tossing back her curls from her forehead dear,<br />
From my hands the flute herself she took.<br />
Now filled the wood was with breath divine<br />
And the heart with holy enchantment filled."<br />
</p>

<p>Before these lines Byelinsky, the great Russian critic, stands
awe-struck. And well he may; for in the Russian <i>such</i> softness,
smoothness, simplicity, harmony, and above all sincerity, had not been
seen before Pushkin's day. And though in the translation everything
except the thought is lost, I too as I now read it over on this
blessed Sunday morn (and the bell calling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> men unto the worship of
the great God is still ringing!), I too feel that even before <i>this</i>
sun, shorn of its beams though it be, I am still in hallowed presence.
For the spirit is independent of tongue, independent of form; to
the god-filled soul the leaf is no less beautiful than the flower.
Discrimination, distinction, is only a sign that we are still detached
from the whole; that we are still only <i>half</i>; that we are still not
our own selves,&mdash;that we still, in short, miss the blessed ONE. To
the god-filled soul the grain of sand is no less beautiful than the
diamond; the spirit breaks through the crust (and words and forms are,
alas, only this!), and recognizes what is its where'er it finds it,
under whate'er disguise. The botanist prizes the weed as highly as the
flower, and with justice, because he seeks not the gratification of the
eye, but of the spirit. The eye is delighted with variety, the spirit
with unity. And the botanist seeks the unity, the whole, the godful in
the plant. And a fine perception it was,&mdash;that of Emerson: that a tree
is but a rooted man, a horse a running man, a fish a floating man, and
a bird a flying man. Logical, practical Supreme Court Justice, with one
eye in the back of his head, declares, indeed, such utterance insane,
and scornfully laughs, "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> don't read Emerson; my garls do!"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>but
the self-same decade brings a Darwin or a Heckel with his comparative
embryos; and at the sight of these, not even a lawyer, be he even Chief
Justice of Supreme Court, can distinguish between snake, fowl, dog, and
man.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>5. In time, however, Pushkin does become objective to himself, as any
true soul that is obliged to reflect must sooner or later; and God ever
sees to it that the soul <i>be</i> obliged to reflect if there be aught
within. For it is the essence of man's life that the soul struggle; it
is the essence of growth that it <i>push</i> upward; it is the essence of
progress in walking that we <i>fall</i> forward. Life is a battle,&mdash;battle
with the powers of darkness; battle with the diseases of doubt,
despair, self-will. And reflection is the symptom that the disease is
on the soul, that the battle is to go on.</p>

<p>6. Pushkin then does become in time objective, and contemplates
himself. Pushkin the man inspects Pushkin the soul, and in the poem,
"My Monument," he gives his own estimate of himself:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"A monument not hand-made I have for me erected;<br />
The path to it well-trodden, will not overgrow;<br />
Risen higher has it with unbending head<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>Than the monument of Alexander.<br />
<br />
No! not all of me shall die! my soul in hallowed lyre<br />
Shall my dust survive, and escape destruction&mdash;<br />
And famous be I shall, as long as on earth sublunar<br />
One bard at least living shall remain.<br />
<br />
"My name will travel over the whole of Russia great<br />
And there pronounce my name shall every living tongue:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .</span><br />
And long to the nation I shall be dear."<br />
</p>

<p>Observe here the native nobility of the man. There is a heroic
consciousness of his own worth which puts to shame all gabble of
conceit and of self-consciousness being a vice, being immodest. Here
too, Emerson sets fine example in not hesitating to speak of his
own essays on Love and Friendship as "those fine lyric strains,"
needing some balance by coarser tones on Prudence and the like. This
is the same heroic consciousness of one's own worth which makes a
Socrates propose as true reward for his services to the State, free
entertainment at the Prytaneum. This is the same manliness which in
a Napoleon rebukes the genealogy-monger who makes him descend from
Charlemagne, with the remark, "I am my own pedigree." This, in fine, is
the same manliness which made Jesus declare boldly, "I am the Way, I am
the Life, I am the Light," regardless of the danger that the "Jerusalem
Advertiser" and the "Zion Nation" might brand him as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> "deliciously
conceited." This recognition of one's own worth is at bottom the
highest reverence before God; inasmuch as I esteem myself, not because
of my body, which I have in common with the brutes, but because of my
spirit, which I have in common with God; and wise men have ever sung,
on hearing their own merit extolled, Not unto us, not unto us! There is
no merit in the matter; the God is either there or he is not....</p>

<p>7. Pushkin, then, even with this in view, is not so much a conscious
will, as an unconscious voice. He is not so much an individual singer,
as a strain from the music of the spheres; and he is a person, an
original voice, only in so far as he has hitched his wagon to a star.
In his abandonment is his greatness; in his self-destruction, his
strength.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"The bidding of God, O Muse, obey.<br />
Fear not insult, ask not crown:<br />
Praise and blame take with indifference<br />
And dispute not with the fool!"<br />
</p>

<p>"And dispute not with the fool!" The prophet never argues; it is
for him only to affirm. Argument is at bottom only a lack of trust
in my own truth. Caesar's wife must be above suspicion: and to bear
misunderstanding in silence,&mdash;this is to be great. Hence the noblest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
moment in Kepler's life was not when he discovered the planet, but
when he discovered that if God could wait six thousand years for the
understanding by man of one of his starlets, <i>he</i> surely could wait a
few brief years for <i>his</i> recognition by his fellow-men. God is the
great misunderstood, and he&mdash;never argues. In living out my truth in
silence, without argument even though misunderstood, I not only show
my faith in it, but prove it by my very strength. If I am understood,
nothing more need be said; if I am not understood, nothing more can be
said. Pushkin, therefore, often weeps, sobs, groans. He at times even
searches, questions, doubts, despairs; but he never argues. Broad is
the back of Pegasus, and strong is his wing, but neither his back nor
his wings shall enable him to float the rhyming arguer. No sooner does
the logician mount the heavenly steed than its wings droop, and both
rider and steed quickly drop into the limbo of inanity. Melancholy,
indeed, is the sight of a dandy dressed for a party unexpectedly
drenched by the shower; sorrowful is the sight of statesman turned
politician before election; and pitiful is the spectacle of the
manufacturing versifier, who grinds out of himself his daily task of
one hundred lines, as the milkman squeezes out his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> daily can of milk
from the cow. But most pitiful of all, immeasurably pathetic to me, is
the sight of pettifogging logician forsaking his hair-splitting world,
and betaking himself to somersaulting verse. To much the bard is indeed
called, but surely not to that....</p>

<p>8. To affirm then the bard is called, and what in "My Monument" is but
hinted, becomes clear, emphatic utterance in Pushkin's "Sonnet to the
Poet."</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Poet, not popular applause shalt thou prize!<br />
Of raptured praise shall pass the momentary noise;<br />
The fool's judgment thou shalt hear, and the cold mob's laughter&mdash;<br />
Calm stand, and firm be, and&mdash;sober!<br />
<br />
"Thou art king: live alone. On the free road<br />
Walk whither draws thee thy spirit free:<br />
Ever the fruits of beloved thoughts ripening,<br />
Never reward for noble deeds demanding.<br />
<br />
"In thyself reward seek. Thine own highest court thou art;<br />
Severest judge, thine own works canst measure.<br />
Art thou content, O fastidious craftsman?<br />
Content? Then let the mob scold,<br />
And spit upon the altar, where blazes thy fire.<br />
Thy tripod in childlike playfulness let it shake."<br />
</p>

<p>But because the bard is called to affirm, to inspire, to <i>serve</i>, he is
also called to be worn. To become the beautiful image, the marble must
be lopped and cut; the vine to bear sweeter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> fruit must be trimmed,
and the soul must go through a baptism of fire.... Growth, progress
is thus ever the casting off of an old self, and <i>Scheiden thut weh</i>.
Detachment hurts. A new birth can take place only amid throes of agony.
Hence the following lines of Pushkin on the poet:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">... No sooner the heavenly word</span><br />
His keen ear hath reached,<br />
Then up trembles the singer's soul<br />
Like an awakened eagle.<br />
<br />
"The world's pastimes now weary him<br />
And mortals' gossip now he shuns.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .</span><br />
Wild and stem rushes he<br />
Of tumult full and sound<br />
To the shores of desert wave<br />
Into the wildly whispering wood."<br />
</p>

<p>9. This is as yet only discernment that the bard must needs suffer;
by-and-by comes also the fulfilment, the recognition of the wisdom
of the sorrow, and with it its joyful acceptance in the poem of "The
Prophet."</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"And out he tore my sinful tongue<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .</span><br />
And ope he cut with sword my breast<br />
And out he took my trembling heart<br />
And a coal with gleaming blaze<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>Into the opened breast he shoved.<br />
Like a corpse I lay in the desert.<br />
And God's Voice unto me called:<br />
Arise, O prophet, and listen, and guide.<br />
Be thou filled with my will<br />
And going over land and sea<br />
Fire with the word the hearts of men!"<br />
</p>

<p>"Be thou filled with my will!" His ideal began with abandonment of
self-will; it ended with complete surrender of self-will. When we have
done all the thinking and planning and weighing, and pride ourselves
upon <i>our</i> wisdom, we are not yet wise. One more step remains to be
taken, without which we only may avoid the wrong; with which, however,
we shall surely come upon the right. We must still say, Teach us, Thou,
to merge our will in Thine....</p>

<h5>II. INNER LIFE.</h5>


<p>10. I have already stated that Pushkin is a subjective writer. The
great feelers must ever be thus, just as the great reasoners must ever
be objective, just as the great lookers can only be objective. For the
eye looks only on the outward thing; the reason looks only upon the
outward effect, the consequence; but the heart looks not only upon the
thing, but upon its reflection upon self,&mdash;upon its moral relation,
in short. Hence the subjectivity of a Tolstoy, a Byron, a Rousseau,
a Jean Paul, a Goethe, who does not become objective until he has
ceased to be a feeler, and becomes the comprehender, the understander,
the seer, the <i>poised</i> Goethe. Marcus Aurelius, Pascal, Amiel, look
into their hearts and write; and Carlyle and Ruskin, even though the
former use "Thou" instead of "I," travel they never so far, still
find their old "I" smiling by their side. But the subjectivity of
Pushkin, unlike that of Walt Whitman, is not only not intrusive, but
it is even delight-giving,&mdash;for it paints not the Pushkin that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
different from all other men, but the Pushkin that is in fellowship
with all other men; he therefore, in reporting himself, voices the
very experience of his fellows, who, though feeling it deeply, were
yet unable to give it tongue. It is this which makes Pushkin the poet
in its original sense,&mdash;the maker, the sayer, the namer. And herein is
his greatness,&mdash;in expressing not what is his, in so far that it is
different from what is other men's, but what is his, <i>because</i> it is
other men's likewise. Herein he is what makes him a man of genius. For
what does a genius do?</p>

<p>11. What is it that makes the water, when spouting forth in a smooth
stream from the hose, such a power? What is it that makes the beauty
of the stem and curve of the body of water, as it leaps out of the
fountain? It is the same water which a few yards back we can see
flowing aimless in stream or pond. Yes, but it is the concentration
of the loose elements into harmonious shape, whether for utility, as
in the case of the hose-spout, or for beauty, as in the case of the
fountain. Nought new is added to the <i>mass</i> existing before. This is
precisely the case of genius. He adds nought to what has gone before
him. He merely arranges, formulates. A vast unorganized mass of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
intelligence, of aspiration, of feeling, becomes diffused over mankind.
Soon it seeks organization. The poet, the prophet, the seer, cometh,
and lo, he becomes the magnet round which all spiritual force of the
time groups itself in visible shape, in formulated language.</p>

<p>12. Pushkin, then, is self-centred; but it is the self that is not
Pushkin, but man. His mood is others' mood; and in singing of his life,
he sings of the life of all men. The demon he sings of in the poem
called "My Demon" is not so much his demon alone as also yours, mine,
ours. It is his demon because it is all men's demon.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"A certain evil spirit then<br />
Began in secret me to visit.<br />
Grievous were our meetings,<br />
His smile, and his wonderful glance,<br />
His speeches, these so stinging,<br />
Cold poison poured into my soul.<br />
Providence with slander<br />
Inexhaustible he tempted;<br />
Of Beauty as a dream he spake<br />
And inspiration he despised;<br />
Nor love, nor freedom trusted he,<br />
On life with scorn he looked&mdash;<br />
And nought in all nature<br />
To bless he ever wished."<br />
</p>

<p>And this demon&mdash;"the Spirit of Denial, the Spirit of Doubt"&mdash;of which
he sings afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span> so pathetically tormented him long. He began with
"Questionings:"&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Useless gift, accidental gift,<br />
Life, why art thou given me?<br />
Or, why by fate mysterious<br />
To torture art thou doomed?<br />
<br />
"Who with hostile power me<br />
Out has called from the nought?<br />
Who my soul with passion thrilled,<br />
Who my spirit with doubt has filled?..."<br />
</p>

<p>And he continues with "Sleeplessness:"&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"I cannot sleep, I have no light;<br />
Darkness 'bout me, and sleep is slow;<br />
The beat monotonous alone<br />
Near me of the clock is heard<br />
Of the Fates the womanish babble,<br />
Of sleeping night the trembling,<br />
Of life the mice-like running-about,&mdash;<br />
Why disturbing me art thou?<br />
What art thou, O tedious whisper?<br />
The reproaches, or the murmur<br />
Of the day by me misspent?<br />
What from me wilt thou have?<br />
Art thou calling or prophesying?<br />
Thee I wish to understand,<br />
Thy tongue obscure I study now."<br />
</p>

<p>13. And this demon gives him no rest, even long after he had found
the answer,&mdash;that the meaning of Life is in <i>Work</i>. Solve the problem
of life? <i>Live</i>, and you solve it; and to live means to do. But that
work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> was the solution of the problem of life he indeed discerned but
vaguely. It was with him not yet conscious fulfilment. He had not yet
formulated to himself the gospel he unconsciously obeyed. Hence the
wavering of the "Task:"&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"The longed-for moment here is. Ended is my long-yeared task.<br />
Why then sadness strange me troubles secretly?<br />
My task done, like needless hireling am I to stand,<br />
My wage in hand, to other task a stranger?<br />
Or my task regret I, of night companion silent mine,<br />
Gold Aurora's friend, the friend of my sacred household gods?"<br />
</p>

<p>14. And for the same reason, when he had ceased to be a roamer and at
last settled down to quiet home-life, the memory of the days of yore
still gives him a pang; and at the sight of the gypsies, whose free and
easy life once occupied his thoughts seriously, not only to sing of
them, but to live with them, only a plaintive note bursts forth from
his soul:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Thee I greet, O happy race!<br />
I recognize thy blazes,<br />
I myself at other times<br />
These tents would have followed.<br />
<br />
"With the early rays to-morrow<br />
Shall disappear your freedom's trace,<br />
Go you will&mdash;but not with you<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>Longer go shall the bard of you.<br />
<br />
"He alas, the changing lodgings,<br />
And the pranks of days of yore<br />
Has forgot for rural comforts<br />
And for the quiet of a home."<br />
</p>

<p>15. And this too when these same "rural comforts" he now regrets to
have taken in exchange for his wanderings were the very circumstances
he sighed for when he did lead the free life he now envies the gypsies
for. For this is what he then had been singing:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Mayhap not long am destined I<br />
In exile peaceful to remain,<br />
Of dear days of yore to sigh<br />
And rustic muse in quiet<br />
With spirit calm to pursue.<br />
<br />
"But even far, in a foreign land<br />
In thought forever roam I shall<br />
Around Trimountain mine:<br />
By meadows, river, by its hills,<br />
By garden, linden, nigh the house."<br />
</p>

<p>16. No wonder, therefore, that the demon, having unsettled the poet's
soul with restlessness, should now unsettle his reasoning powers
with regrets. For regret is at bottom a disease, an inability to
perceive that the best way to mend harm once done is not in lamenting
the past, but in struggling for a future; in which future much of
the past could be undone; or if it could not be undone, at least it
could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> prevented from contaminating with its corpse the life of
the future. And his regret is bitter enough. In the first of the two
poems, "Regret" and "Reminiscence," the feeling again is as yet only
discernment; but in the second, the poison has already entered his
soul, and accordingly it no longer is a song, but a cry of agony....</p>

<p>At first it is is only&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"But where are ye, O moments tender<br />
Of young my hopes, of heartfelt peace?<br />
The former heat and grace of inspiration?<br />
Come again, O ye, of spring my years!"<br />
</p>

<p>But later it becomes&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Before me memory in silence<br />
Its lengthy roll unfolds,<br />
And with disgust my life I reading<br />
Tremble I and curse it.<br />
Bitterly I moan, and bitterly my tears I shed<br />
But wash away the lines of grief I cannot.<br />
In laziness, in senseless feasts,<br />
In the madness of ruinous license,<br />
In thraldom, poverty, and homeless deserts<br />
My wasted years there I behold...."<br />
</p>

<p>17. Regret, in itself a disease, but only of the intellect,
soon changes into a more violent disease: into a disease of the
constitution, which is fear, fear of insanity. In ordinary minds such
disease takes the form of fear for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> the future, of worry for existence;
in extraordinary minds it takes more ghastly shapes,&mdash;distrust of
friends, and dread of the close embrace of what is already stretching
forth its claws after the soul,&mdash;insanity.</p>

<p>Hence,&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"God grant I grow not insane:<br />

<p>18. That thoughts of death should now be his companions is only to be
expected. But here again his muse plainly sings itself out in both
stages,&mdash;the stage of discernment and the stage of fulfilment. In the
first of the two poems, "Elegy" and "Death-Thoughts" he only <i>thinks</i>
of death; in the second he already <i>longs</i> for it.</p>

<p>19. Pushkin died young; that he would have conquered his demon in time
there is every reason to believe, though the fact that he had not yet
conquered him at the age of thirty-eight must show the tremendous
force of bad blood, and still worse circumstance, which combined made
the demon of Pushkin. But already he shows signs of having seen the
promised land.</p>

<p class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></p>

<p>In the three poems, "Resurrection," "The Birdlet" (iv. 133), and
"Consolation," the first shows that he conquered his regret-disease;
the second, that he already found in Love <i>some</i> consolation for
sorrow. And the third shows that he already felt his way at least to
<i>some</i> peace, even though it be not yet <i>faith</i> in the future, but only
hope. For hope is not yet knowledge; it only trusts that the future
will be good. Faith knows that the future <i>must</i> be good, because it is
in the hands of God, the Good.</p>

<h5>III. GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS.</h5>


<p>20. I have translated the poems of Pushkin not so much because they
are masterpieces in the literature of Russia, as because I think the
English reading-public has much to learn from him. English literature
is already blessed with masterpieces, which, if readers would only
be content to study them for the sake of what they have to <i>impart</i>
(not amuse with!), would give enough employment as well as amusement
for all the time an ordinary reader can give to literature. So that
merely for the sake of making new beauty accessible to English readers,
it is hardly worth while to go out of English literature, and drag
over from beyond the Atlantic poor Pushkin as a new beast in a circus
for admiration. The craze for novelty has its place in human nature
but not as an end in itself. As a literary method, it might be found
commendable in a magazine editor, whose highest ambition is to follow
the standard of a public even he does not respect. It might be found
commendable in a gifted author to whom bread is dearer than <i>his</i>
genius, so that he is ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> sacrifice the one to the other; but an
inexperienced author, who has not yet learned wisdom (or is it prudence
merely?) from the bitter literary disappointments which are surely in
store for every earnest, aspiring soul,&mdash;such an author, I say,&mdash;must
not be expected to make <i>mere</i> novelty his motive for serious work.
Nay, the conclusion at which Pascal arrived, at the age of twenty-six,
that there is really only <i>one</i> book that to an earnest soul is
sufficient for a lifetime to read,&mdash;namely, the Bible,&mdash;extravagant
though this sound, I am ready, after many years of reflection on this
saying of Pascal, to subscribe to, even at an age when I have six
years of experience additional to his.... To read much, but not many
books, is old wisdom, yet ever new. A literary masterpiece is to be
read, not once, nor twice, nor thrice, but scores of times. A literary
masterpiece should, like true love, grow dearer with intercourse. A
literary masterpiece should be read and re-read until it has become
part of our flesh and circulates in our blood, until its purity, its
loftiness, its wisdom, utter itself in our every deed. It is this
devotion to one book that has made the Puritans of such heroic mould;
they <i>fed</i> on one book until they talked and walked and lived out their
spiritual food. If any one think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> this estimate of the influence of one
great book exaggerated, let him try to live for one week in succession
wholly in the spirit of the one book that to him is <i>the</i> book (I
will not quarrel with him if it be Smiles instead of St. Matthew, or
Malthus's Essay on Population instead of the Gospel of St. John, or
even our modern realistic Gospel of dirt), and let him see what will
come of it.</p>

<p>21. Shakespeare, Milton, Carlyle, Ruskin, Emerson, Scott, Goldsmith,
Irving, Johnson, Addison, furnish a library which is really enough for
the life-time of <i>any</i> one who takes life seriously, and comes to these
masters, not as a conceited lord waiting for amusement,&mdash;as a judge,
in short,&mdash;but as a beggar, an humble learner, hoping to carry away
from them not the tickle of pleasure, but the life-giving sustenance.
To <i>make</i> letters a source of amusement is but to dig for iron with a
spade of gold. Amusement is indeed often necessary, just as roasting
eggs is often necessary; but who would travel to a volcano for the
sake of roasting his eggs? No, the masters in letters are not sent to
us for our amusement; they are sent to us to give the one answer to
each of us, which at the peril of our lives we must sooner or later
receive,&mdash;the answer to the question: How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> shall we live to be worthy
of that spark from heaven which is given us in trust to keep alive for
the brief years of life on earth? The great masters, then, are the
inspirers; and God ever sees to it that there be enough inspirers, if
men but see to it that there be enough inspired.</p>

<p>22. But of the millions of the English-speaking readers, who to-day
<i>assimilates</i> the masterpieces of English literature? Generations come,
and generations go. The classic writers keep their reputation; but do
they hold their readers? Do the readers hold to the masters? Not the
masters sway the public taste, not the writers of the first rank, not
the giants; but the pygmies, the minions, the men of the second, fifth,
twentieth rank. If any one think me extravagant, let him cast a glance
of his <i>open</i> eyes at our monthly reviews and magazines, both here
and in England, especially those whose circulation reaches into the
hundreds of thousands....</p>

<p>23. Not, then, because <i>additional</i> masterpieces are needed for rousing
our degenerate literary taste have I translated Pushkin. As long as the
literary editors (who, from the very fact of once having the ear of the
public, become the <i>stewards of the hungry</i>) insist on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> feeding it with
the Roes and the Crawfords and the Haggards and the Stevensons and the
rest of them, not only new masterpieces, but even the old ones will
remain unread. The Bible lies on parlor table (if it ever get there!)
unread; Milton lies indeed beautifully bound, but has to be dusted once
a week; and Emerson need not even be dusted,&mdash;he has not yet got as far
as to be the ornament of parlor table.</p>

<p>But I have translated Pushkin because I believe that even the masters
of English literature have defects which are part of the English
character; and as such they must reappear in its literature. And it is
against these that Pushkin's poems offer a healthy remedy.</p>

<p>24. For the first characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon race is that it is
a race of talkers; and the destinies of the two most advanced nations
of that race are to-day governed almost wholly by men whose strength
is neither in the head nor in the will nor in the heart, but in the
tongue. But the talker cares only for the effect of the moment. With
the great hereafter he has but little to do; hence he becomes, first of
all, a resounder, a thunderer, a sky-rockety dazzler. And once that,
the orator need not even care whether he persuade or not; if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> merely
astound the ear, dazzle the eye, and overwhelm the hearer himself for
the moment,&mdash;if, in short, he but produce <i>an</i> effect, even if it be
not <i>the</i> effect desired,&mdash;it is well with him in his own estimation.
The orator thus soon becomes the mere rhetorician. And this rhetorical
quality, appealing as it does only to the superficial in man, and
coming as it does only from the surface of the man, is found nowhere
in such excess as in the poetry of the Anglo-Saxon race. Ornament,
metaphor, must be had, and if it cannot be had spontaneously from a
fervid imagination, which alone is the legitimate producer of metaphor,
recourse must be had to manufactured sound. Hence there is scarcely a
single poet in the English tongue whose style is not vitiated by false
metaphor; this is true of the greatest as well as of the least. The
member of Parliament who smelt a rat, and saw it brewing in the air
until it was in danger of becoming an apple of discord to the honorable
members of the House, could have been born only on British soil. To
take up arms against a sea of trouble, and to discover footprints in
the sands of time while sailing over life's solemn main (no less than
five false metaphors in this example from the Psalm of Life!) are feats
that can be accomplished by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> imagination of even a Shakespeare or a
Longfellow solely because these are Anglo-Saxons. And I am yet to see
five consecutive pages of any Anglo-Saxon poet free from this literary
vice of false metaphor! I call this a vice because it is at bottom an
insincerity of imagination. The false metaphors are not pictures seen,
but pictures made up; they are not the spontaneous outbursts of an
overflowing imagination, but the ground-out product of pictureless will
for the sake of effect. And this I do not hesitate to call literary
insincerity even though the process of making them up be unconscious at
the time to the poet himself.</p>

<p>25. Now it is Pushkin's great virtue that his imagination is eminently
spontaneous. He seldom uses adjectives; but when he does use them,
he uses such only as do actually describe something. He seldom
uses similes or metaphors,&mdash;he prefers to sing of the subjects
themselves, not of what they resemble; but when he does use them,
the reader's imagination is able to <i>see</i> the picture the poet had
in mind, which is not often true of the English bards. Examples for
comparison are innumerable; let a few suffice. Turn to Pushkin's
lines, "Regret." He there regrets the days of his youth, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> first
tells by way of contrast what he does not regret; and his poem is
simple, straightforward. Byron, however, in his "Stanzas for Music,"
of which Canon Farrar thought well enough to insert them in his "With
the Poets," and Mr. Palgrave thinks good enough to be admitted into
his "Treasury of English Poetry," finds it necessary to preface it
with something like philosophical remarks, and then proceeds in this
fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Then the few whose <i>spirits float above the wreck of happiness</i><br />
<i>Are driven o'er the shoals of guilt or ocean of excess:</i><br />
<i>The magnet of their course is gone, or only points in vain</i><br />
<i>The shore to which their shivered sail shall never stretch again</i>.<br />
<br />
"Then <i>the mortal coldness of the soul</i> till death itself comes down;<br />
It cannot feel for other's woes, it dare not dream it's own.<br />
<i>That heavy chill has frozen o'er the fountain of our tears</i>,<br />
And though the eye may sparkle still, 't is where the ice appears,<br />
<br />
"Oh, could I feel as I have felt, or be what I have been,<br />
Or weep as I could once have wept o'er many a vanished scene,<br />
As springs in deserts found seem sweet, all brackish though they be,<br />
<i>So midst the withered waste of life,</i> those tears would flow to me."<br />
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>One must go to Shakespeare's Sonnets for poetry as false as this. Among
writers with the true poetic feeling, such as Byron truly had, I know
not the like of this except these. Of these twelve lines only the first
two of the last stanza are <i>true</i>, are <i>felt;</i> the rest are <i>made.</i> How
are <i>we</i>, not Arabs but English-talking folk, to know the springs which
in deserts found seem (<i>do</i> they?) sweet, brackish though they be? And
Byron <i>was</i> a poet! But even a Byron cannot make a shivered sail or
a coldness of a soul which is mortal, or a chill that freezes over a
fountain of tears anything but mere verbiage, and verbiage moreover
which instead of the intended sadness is dangerously nigh raising
laughter....</p>

<p>26. Again, take Longfellow's "Hymn to Night:"&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"I heard the trailing garments of the night<br />
Sweep through her marble halls!<br />
I saw her sable skirts all fringed with light<br />
From the celestial walls.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">.&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .&nbsp; .</span><br />
From the cool cisterns of the midnight air,<br />
My spirit drank repose."<br />
</p>

<p>For the like of this one can no longer go even to Shakespeare's
Sonnets. For Shakespeare was still a poet. One must now go to Mrs.
Deland, who is not even that. For observe:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Night has halls, and these halls are marble halls; and this
marble-hailed Night is unable to stay at home, and must go forth, and
accordingly she does go in full dress with her garments trailing with
a right gracious sweep. And the bard not only sees the sable skirts
which dangle about in fringes made phosphorescent by contact with
the celestial walls of such peculiar marble, but he even hears the
rustle.... And these halls with accommodating grace are changed into
cool, deep cisterns from which accordingly the bard's spirit with due
solemnity draws into his spirit's wide-opened mouth a draught of repose.</p>

<p>27. Turn from this "Hymn to Night" of thirty lines to the three lines
of Pushkin in his "Reminiscence," which alone he devotes to Night:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"When noisy day to mortals quiet grows,<br />
And upon the city's silent walls<br />
<i>Night's shadow half-transparent lies."</i><br />
</p>

<p>The marble halls and the trailing garments were <i>ground out</i> from the
writer's fingers; the half-transparent shadow of the poet <i>came</i> to the
poet....</p>

<p>28. After such examples of wretchedness from real giants such as Byron
and Longfellow indisputably are, I do not hesitate to ask the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span> reader
for a last example to turn first to Pushkin's "Cloud," and then read
Shelley's poem on the same subject:&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"I bear light shade for the leaves <i>when laid<br />
In their noonday dreams</i>. [Just <i>how</i> are leaves thus laid?]<br />
From my wings are shaken the dews that waken<br />
The sweet buds every one,<br />
<i>When rocked to rest on their mother's breast</i>,<br />
<i>As she dances about in the sun."</i><br />
</p>

<p>(Oh, good, my Shelley! one <i>dances</i> to and fro; one cannot dance in
a uniform, straightforward motion. Thy imagination never <i>saw</i> THAT
picture! Spin, whirl, rush,&mdash;yes, but <i>dance</i>?)</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"That orbèd maiden with white fire laden<br />
Whom mortals call the Moon<br />
<i>Glides glimmering o'er my fleece-like floor</i>,<br />
By the midnight breezes strewn;<br />
<i>And wherever the beat of her unseen feet</i><br />
Which only the angels hear<br />
May have broken the woof of my tent's roof,<br />
The stars peep behind her and peer."<br />
</p>

<p>Who has not been stirred by the sight of the fleece-like, broken clouds
on a moonlight night? But who on looking up to that noble arch overhead
at such a moment could <i>see</i> it as a <i>floor</i>?...</p>

<p>29. I call this wretched poetry, even though other critics vociferously
declare Shelley's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span> "Cloud" to be one of the masterpieces of the English
language. <i>De gustibus non disputandum</i>. The Chinese have a liking, it
is said, for black teeth, and a bulb of a nose is considered a great
beauty in some parts of Africa, and a human leg is considered a great
delicacy by some Islanders; but....</p>

<p>30. And the second characteristic of the Anglo-Saxon race, which,
however valuable it may prove in practical life, is reflected
disastrously in its poetry, is its incapacity to appreciate true
sentiment. An Anglo-Saxon knows sentimentality when he sees it, he
knows morbidness when he sees it; but the healthy sentiment of which
these are but the diseases he is incapable of appreciating to a depth
where it would become part of his life. Hence, though a Malthus might
have written his Essay on Population anywhere, since it is a truly
cosmopolitan book, a Malthusian doctrine with all that it means and
stands for could have grown up only on British soil; and though the
warning voice against the dangers of sentimental charity (<i>if</i> there
really be such a thing, and <i>if</i> such a thing, supposing it to exist,
be really dangerous!) might be lifted in any land, the hard, frigid,
almost brutal doctrine of scientific charity could strike root only
in London, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> blossom out in full array only in a city like Boston.
The reader will please observe that I do not here undertake to judge.
Malthusian doctrine, scientific charity, brutality of any kind may be
necessary, for aught I know. A great many well-meaning and kind-hearted
people have in sober thought decided that it often is necessary. I
am only stating what seems to me to be a fact. To me this is a most
melancholy fact; to others it may be a joyful fact. But whether joyful
or melancholy, this fact explains why so little sentiment is found
among the Anglo-Saxon poets even when they <i>feel</i> their passions, and
do not, as is usually the case with them, reason about them, or what is
worse, compose far-fetched similes about them. Glimpses of sentiment
are of course found now and then, but only now and then. It is not
often that Wordsworth sings in such pure strains as that of the lines,&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"My heart leaps up when I behold<br />
A Rainbow in the sky."<br />
</p>

<p>It is not often that Byron strikes a chord as deep as that of the lines
"In an Album:"&mdash;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"As o'er the cold, sepulchral stone,<br />
Some name arrests the passer-by."<br />
</p>

<p>It is here, however, that Pushkin is unsurpassed. One must go to Heine,
one must go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> to Uhland, to Goethe, to find the like of him. And what
makes him master here is the fact that his sentiment comes out pure,
that it comes forth fused. And it comes thus because it comes from
the depths; and as such it must find response even in an Anglo-Saxon
heart, provided it has not yet been eaten into by Malthusian law and
scientific charity. Pushkin's sentiment extorts respect even where it
finds no longer any response; and as the sight of nobility stirs a
healthy soul to noble deeds, as the sight of beauty refines the eye,
so the presence of true sentiment can only awaken whatever sentiment
already sleeps within us. It is for supplying this glaring defect in
the English poets that a reading of Pushkin becomes invaluable. I
almost fear to quote or compare. Sentiment cannot be argued about;
like all else of the highest, deepest, like God, like love, it must be
<i>felt</i>. Where it is understood, nothing need be said; where it is not
understood, nothing can be said....</p>

<p>31. And yet a single example I venture to give. Pushkin's "Inspiring
Love" and Wordsworth's "Phantom of Delight" treat of the same theme.
Pushkin sees his beloved again, and after years&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"Enraptured beats again my heart,<br />
And risen are for it again<br />
Both reverence and Inspiration<br />
And life, and tears, and love."<br />
</p>

<p>Wordsworth also gets now a nearer view of his "Phantom of Delight;" and
the sight rouses him to this pitch of enthusiastic sentiment:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10%;">
"And now I see with eye serene,<br />
The very pulse of the <i>machine</i>."<br />
</p>

<p>In the presence of such bungling, I am almost ashamed to call
attention, not to the machine that has a pulse, but to that noble woman
who, purified, clarified in the imagination by the heat of a melted
heart, can only become to the poet, a&mdash;machine. And this is the poet
(whose very essence should be sensitiveness, delicacy, <i>sentiment</i>) who
is ranked by Matthew Arnold as the greatest poet since Shakespeare....</p>

<p>32. I have given only one example, though there is hardly a volume of
English poetry, with the possible exception of those of Burns, which
does not furnish dozens of examples. If I give only one, it is because
I have in mind Æsop's lioness, who gave such smart reply when chided
for giving birth to only one young....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>33. There is, indeed, one poet in the English language whose pages
throb with sentiment, and who is moreover singularly free from that
literary vice which I have called insincerity of imagination; in purity
of pictures, in simplicity of sentiment, Goldsmith is unsurpassed in
any tongue, but Goldsmith was not an Anglo-Saxon. And even Macaulay's
great praise of "The Traveller" has not been sufficient to give it
a place of <i>authority</i> among readers. The persons that read "The
Traveller" once a year, as such a possession for all times should be
read by rational readers, are very few.</p>

<p>34. From what I have designated as the first characteristic of the
Anglo-Saxon race&mdash;its rhetorical quality&mdash;springs the second, which
I have designated as the superficiality of sentiment; since the
rhetorician needs no depth, and when he does need it, he needs it only
for the moment. And from this same rhetorical quality springs the
third characteristic of English writers which appears in literature
as a vice. I mean their comparative lack of the sense of form, of
measuredness, literary temperance,&mdash;the want, in short, of the
<i>artistic</i> sense. For architectural proportion, with beginning, middle,
and end in proper relation, English poets have but little respect, and
it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> here that Pushkin is again master. It is the essence of poetry,
that which makes it <i>not-prose</i>, that it is intense; but intensity to
produce its effect must be short-lived. Prolonged, like a stimulant,
it ceases to act. Hence, one of the first laws of poetry is that the
presentation of its scenes, emotions, episodes, be brief. Against this
law the sins in English literature among its masters are innumerable.
Take, for instance, the manner in which Pushkin, on the one hand, and
English poets, on the other, treat an object which has ever affected
men with poetic emotion.</p>

<p>35. Many are the English poets who have tried their voices in singing
of birds; Wordsworth's lines to the Skylark, the Green Linnet, the
Cuckoo, Shelley's piece "To a Skylark," Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale,"
Bryant's "Lines to a Waterfowl," attest sufficiently the inspiration
which tender birdie hath for the soul of man. Now read these in the
light of Pushkin's twenty lines called "The Birdlet." Bryant alone, it
seems to me, holds his own by the side of Pushkin. Shelley and Keats
are lengthy to weariness; and Wordsworth is almost painfully tame. What
thoughtlet or emotionlet these are stirred with at the sight of birdie
is like a babe in the swaddling-clothes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> of fond, but inexperienced
parents, suffocated in its wrappage.</p>

<p>36. This measuredness Pushkin displays best in his narrative poems.
His story <i>moves.</i> His "Delibash" is the finest example of rapidity of
execution combined with fidelity of skill. And the vividness of his
stories in "The Drowned," "The Roussalka," and "The Cossak," is due not
so much to the dramatic talent Pushkin doubtless possessed as to the
sense of proportion which saved him from loading his narrative with
needless detail. Gray's "Elegy," for instance, matchless in its beauty,
is marred by the needless appendage of the youth himself. This part of
the poem seems <i>patched on</i> Wordsworth's "Lucy Gray" seems to justify
Goldsmith's bold metaphor,&mdash;for it does drag a lengthening chain at
each remove. Longfellow's "Prelude" has like "Sartor Resartus" a most
unwieldy apparatus for getting ready. The poet there is ever ready to
say something, but hardly says it even at the end. And even Tennyson,
who at one time did know what it was to keep fine poise in such
matters, is frequently guilty of this merely getting ready to say his
say.</p>

<p>37. These, then, are the three great virtues of Pushkin's poems: They
have sincere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> imagination, which means pure taste; they have true
sentiment, which means pure depth; they have true measure, which means
pure art. Pushkin has many more virtues which are common to all great
poets; but of these three I thought necessary to speak in detail.</p>

MY PEDIGREE.<br />
<br />
IV. 66.<br />
<br />
<br />
With scorning laughter at a fellow writer,<br />
In a chorus the Russian scribes<br />
With name of aristocrat me chide:<br />
Just look, if please you ... nonsense what!<br />
Court Coachman not I, nor assessor,<br />
Nor am I nobleman by cross;<br />
No academician, nor professor,<br />
I'm simply of Russia a citizen.<br />
<br />
Well I know the times' corruption,<br />
And, surely, not gainsay it shall I:<br />
Our nobility but recent is:<br />
The more recent it, the more noble 't is.<br />
But of humbled races a chip,<br />
And, God be thanked, not alone<br />
Of ancient Lords am scion I;<br />
Citizen I am, a citizen!<br />
<br />
Not in cakes my grandsire traded,<br />
Not a prince was newly-baked he;<br />
Nor at church sang he in choir,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>Nor polished he the boots of Tsar;<br />
Was not escaped a soldier he<br />
From the German powdered ranks;<br />
How then aristocrat am I to be?<br />
God be thanked, I am but a citizen.<br />
<br />
My grandsire Radsha in warlike service<br />
To Alexander Nefsky was attached.<br />
The Crowned Wrathful, Fourth Ivan,<br />
His descendants in his ire had spared.<br />
About the Tsars the Pushkins moved;<br />
And more than one acquired renown,<br />
When against the Poles battling was<br />
Of Nizhny Novgorod the citizen plain.<br />
<br />
When treason conquered was and falsehood,<br />
And the rage of storm of war,<br />
When the Romanoffs upon the throne<br />
The nation called by its Chart&mdash;<br />
We upon it laid our hands;<br />
The martyr's son then favored us;<br />
Time was, our race was prized,<br />
But I ... am but a citizen obscure.<br />
<br />
Our stubborn spirit us tricks has played;<br />
Most irrepressible of his race,<br />
With Peter my sire could not get on;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>And for this was hung by him.<br />
Let his example a lesson be:<br />
Not contradiction loves a ruler,<br />
Not all can be Prince Dolgorukys,<br />
Happy only is the simple citizen.<br />
<br />
My grandfather, when the rebels rose<br />
In the palace of Peterhof,<br />
Like Munich, faithful he remained<br />
To the fallen Peter Third;<br />
To honor came then the Orloffs,<br />
But my sire into fortress, prison&mdash;<br />
Quiet now was our stern race,<br />
And I was born merely&mdash;citizen.<br />
<br />
Beneath my crested seal<br />
The roll of family charts I've kept;<br />
Not running after magnates new,<br />
My pride of blood I have subdued;<br />
I'm but an unknown singer<br />
Simply Pushkin, not Moussin,<br />
My strength is mine, not from court:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>I am a writer, a citizen.<br />

MY MONUMENT.<br />
<br />
IV. 23.<br />
<br />
<br />
A monument not hand-made I have for me erected;<br />
The path to it well-trodden will not overgrow;<br />
Risen higher has it with unbending head<br />
Than the monument of Alexander.<br />
<br />
No! not all of me shall die! my soul in hallowed lyre<br />
Shall my dust survive, and escape destruction&mdash;<br />
And famous be I shall, as long as on earth sublunar<br />
One bard at least living shall remain.<br />
<br />
My name will travel over the whole of Russia great,<br />
And there pronounce my name shall every living tongue:<br />
The Slav's proud scion, and the Finn, and the savage yet<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>Tungus, and the Calmuck, lover of the steppe.<br />
<br />
And long to the nation I shall be dear:<br />
For rousing with my lyre its noble feelings.<br />
For extolling freedom in a cruel age,<br />
For calling mercy upon the fallen.<br />
<br />
The bidding of God, O Muse, obey.<br />
Fear not insult, ask not crown:<br />
Praise and blame take with indifference<br />
And dispute not with the fool!<br />

MY MUSE.<br />
<br />
IV. 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the days of my youth she was fond of me,<br />
And the seven-stemmed flute she handed me.<br />
To me with smile she listened; and already gently<br />
Along the openings echoing of the woods<br />
Was playing I with fingers tender:<br />
Both hymns solemn, god-inspired<br />
And peaceful song of Phrygian shepherd.<br />
From morn till night in oak's dumb shadow<br />
To the strange maid's teaching intent I listened;<br />
And with sparing reward me gladdening<br />
Tossing back her curls from her forehead dear,<br />
From my hands the flute herself she took.<br />
Now filled the wood was with breath divine<br />
And the heart with holy enchantment filled.<br />

In those days when new to me were<br />
Of existence all impressions:&mdash;<br />
The maiden's glances, the forests' whisper,<br />
The song of nightingale at night;<br />
When the sentiments elevated<br />
Of Freedom, glory and of love,<br />
And of art the inspiration<br />
Stirred deeply so my blood:&mdash;<br />
My hopeful hours and joyful<br />
With melancholy sudden dark'ning<br />
A certain evil spirit then<br />
Began in secret me to visit.<br />
Grievous were our meetings,<br />
His smile, and his wonderful glance,<br />
His speeches, these so stinging<br />
Cold poison poured into my soul.<br />
Providence with slander<br />
Inexhaustible he tempted;<br />
Of Beauty as a dream he spake<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>And inspiration he despised;<br />
Nor love, nor freedom trusted he,<br />
On life with scorn he looked&mdash;<br />
And nought in all nature<br />
To bless he ever wished.<br />

REGRET.<br />
<br />
IV. 76.<br />

Not ye regret I, of spring my years,<br />
In dreams gone by of hopeless love;<br />

Nor crowns of feasts, nor cups of circle,<br />
Nor ye regret I, O traitresses young&mdash;<br />
To pleasures melancholy stranger am I.<br />

But where are ye, O moments tender<br />
Of young my hopes, of heartfelt peace?<br />

REMINISCENCE.<br />
<br />
IV. 96.<br />
<br />
<br />
When noisy day to mortals quiet grows,<br />
And upon the city's silent walls<br />
Night's shadow half-transparent lies,<br />
And Sleep, of daily toils reward,&mdash;<br />
Then for me are dragging in the silence<br />
Of wearying wakefulness the hours.<br />
In the sloth of night more scorching burn<br />
My heart's serpents' gnawing fangs;<br />
Boil my thoughts; my soul with grief oppressed<br />
Full of reveries sad is thronged.<br />
Before me memory in silence<br />
Its lengthy roll unfolds.<br />
And with disgust my life I reading<br />
Tremble I and curse it.<br />
Bitterly I moan, and bitterly my tears I shed,<br />
But wash away the lines of grief I cannot.<br />
<br />
In laziness, in senseless feasts<br />
In the craziness of ruinous license,<br />
In thraldom, poverty, and homeless deserts<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>My wasted years there I behold.<br />
Of friends again I hear the treacherous greeting<br />
Games amid of love and wine.<br />
To the heart again insults brings<br />
Irrepressible the cold world.<br />
No joy for me,&mdash;and calmly before me<br />
Of visions young two now rise:<br />
Two tender shades, two angels me<br />
Given by fate in the days of yore.<br />
But both have wings and flaming swords,<br />
And they watch&mdash;... and both are vengeant,<br />
And both to me speak with death tongue<br />
Of Eternity's mysteries, and of the grave.<br />

The fruit of emptiness of heart.<br />

Faded has my blooming crown!<br />
Sad I live and lonely,<br />
And wait: Is nigh my end?<br />

When storm's wintry whistle is heard,<br />

The work of genius is 'gain before us,<br />

Tormented by the thirst for the spirit<br />

With fingers as light as a dream<br />
Mine eyes he touched:<br />
And mine eyes opened wise<br />
Like the eyes of a frightened eagle;<br />
He touched mine ears,<br />
And they filled with din and ringing.<br />
And I heard the trembling of the heavens<br />
And the flight of the angel's wings,<br />
And the creeping of the polyps in the sea,<br />
And the growth of the vine in the valley.<br />
And he took hold of my lips,<br />
And out he tore my sinful tongue<br />
With its empty and false speech.<br />
And the fang of the wise serpent<br />
Between my terrified lips he placed<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>With bloody hand.<br />
And ope he cut with sword my breast,<br />
And out he took my trembling heart,<br />
And a coal with flaming blaze<br />
Into the opened breast he shoved.<br />
Like a corpse I lay in the desert.<br />
And the voice of God unto me called:<br />
Arise, O prophet, and listen, and guide.<br />
Be thou filled with my will,<br />
And going over land and sea<br />
Fire with the word the hearts of men!<br />

<br />THE OUTCAST.<br />
<br />
III. 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a rainy autumn evening<br />
Into desert places went a maid;<br />
And the secret fruit of unhappy love<br />
In her trembling hands she held.<br />
All was still: the hills and the woods<br />
Asleep in the darkness of the night.<br />
And her searching glances<br />
In terror about she cast.<br />
<br />
And on this babe, the innocent,<br />
Her glance she paused with a sigh:<br />
Asleep thou art, my child, my grief.<br />
Thou knowest not my sadness.<br />
Thine eyes will ope, and tho' with longing,<br />
To my breast shalt no more cling.<br />
No kiss for thee to-morrow<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>From thine unhappy mother.<br />
<br />
Beckon in vain for her thou wilt,<br />
My everlasting shame, my guilt!<br />
Me forget thou shalt for aye,<br />
But thee forget shall not I.<br />
Shelter thou shalt receive from strangers,<br />
Who 'll say: Thou art none of ours!<br />
Thou wilt ask, Where are my parents?<br />
But for thee no kin is found!<br />
<br />
Hapless one! With heart filled with sorrow,<br />
Lonely amid thy mates,<br />
Thy spirit sullen to the end,<br />
Thou shalt behold fondling mothers.<br />
A lonely wanderer everywhere<br />
Cursing thy fate at all times,<br />
Thou the bitter reproach shalt hear....<br />
Forgive me, oh, forgive me then!<br />
<br />
Asleep! let me then, O hapless one<br />
To my bosom press thee once for all.<br />
A law unjust and terrible<br />
Thee and me to sorrow dooms.<br />
While the years have not yet chased<br />
The guiltless joy of thy days,<br />
Sleep, my darling, let no griefs bitter<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>Mar thy childhood's quiet life!<br />
<br />
But lo! behind the woods, near by<br />
The moon brings a hut to light.<br />
Forlorn, pale, and trembling<br />
To the doors nigh she came.<br />
She stooped and gently laid she down<br />
The babe on the threshold strange.<br />
In terror away her eyes she turned<br />
And in the dark night disappeared.<br />

THE BLACK SHAWL.<br />
<br />
III. 83.<br />
<br />
<br />
I gaze demented on the black shawl<br />
And my cold soul is torn by grief.<br />
<br />
When young I was and full of trust<br />
I passionately loved a young Greek girl.<br />
<br />
The charming maid, she fondled me,<br />
But soon I lived the black day to see.<br />
<br />
Once as were gathered my jolly guests<br />
A detested Jew knocked at my door.<br />
<br />
Thou art feasting (he whispered) with friends<br />
But betrayed thou art by thy Greek maid.<br />
<br />
Moneys I gave him and curses,<br />
And called my servant the faithful.<br />
<br />
We went: I flew on the wings of my steed;<br />
And tender mercy was silent in me.<br />
<br />
Her threshold no sooner I espied<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>Dark grew my eyes, and my strength departed.<br />
<br />
The distant chamber I enter alone,<br />
An Armenian embraces my faithless maid.<br />
<br />
Darkness around me; flashed the dagger;<br />
To interrupt his kiss the wretch had no time.<br />
<br />
And long I trampled the headless corpse,&mdash;<br />
And silent and pale at the maid I stared.<br />
<br />
I remember her prayers, her flowing blood,<br />
But perished the girl, and with her my love.<br />
<br />
The shawl I took from the head now dead<br />
And wiped in silence the bleeding steel.<br />
<br />
When came the darkness of eve, my serf<br />
Threw their bodies into the Danube's billows&mdash;<br />
<br />
Since then I kiss no charming eyes,<br />
Since then I know no cheerful days.<br />
<br />
I gaze demented on the black shawl,<br />
And my cold soul is torn by grief.<br />

THE ROUSSALKA.<br />
<br />
III. 71.<br />
<br />
<br />
By a lake once in forest darkness<br />
A monk his soul was saving,<br />
Ever in stern occupation<br />
Of prayer, fast, and labor.<br />
Already with slackened shovel<br />
The aged man his grave was digging,<br />
And only for death in peace and quiet<br />
To his saintly patrons prayed he.<br />
<br />
Once in summer at the threshold<br />
Of his drooping little hut<br />
To God was praying the hermit.<br />
Darker grew the forest.<br />
Over the lake was rising fog.<br />
And in the clouds the reddish moon<br />
Was gently rolling along the sky.<br />
Upon the waters the hermit gazed.<br />
<br />
He looks, and fears, and knows not why,<br />
Himself he cannot understand....<br />
Now he sees: the waves are seething<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>And suddenly again are quiet....<br />
<br />
Suddenly ... as light as shade of night,<br />
As white as early snow of hills,<br />
Out cometh a woman naked<br />
And on the shore herself she seats.<br />
<br />
Upon the aged monk she gazes<br />
And she combs her moistened tresses&mdash;<br />
The holy monk with terror trembles,<br />
Upon her charms still he gazes;<br />
With her hand to him she beckons<br />
And her head she's quickly nodding....<br />
And suddenly like a falling star<br />
The dreamy wave she vanished under.<br />
<br />
The sober monk, all night he slept not,<br />
And all day he prayed not<br />
The shadow unwittingly before him<br />
Of the wondrous maid he ever sees.<br />
Again the forest is clad in darkness,<br />
Along the clouds the moon is sailing.<br />
Again the maid above the water,<br />
Pale and splendent there she sits.<br />
<br />
Gaze her eyes, nods her head,<br />
Throws kisses, and she's sporting,<br />
The wave she sprinkles, and she frolics;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>Child-like weeping now and laughing;<br />
<br />
Sobbing tender&mdash;the monk she calls:<br />
Monk, O monk, to me, to me!<br />
Into the waves transparent she dashes;<br />
And again is all in silence deep.<br />
<br />
But on the third day the roused hermit<br />
The enchanted shores nigh sitting was,<br />
And the beautiful maid he awaited.<br />
Upon the trees were falling shades....<br />
Night at last by dawn was chased&mdash;<br />
And nowhere monk could be found,<br />
His beard alone, the gray one<br />
In the water the boys could see.<br />

THE COSSAK.<br />
<br />
III. 14.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once at midnight hour,<br />
Darkness thro' and fog,<br />
Quiet by the river<br />
Rode a Cossak brave.<br />
<br />
Black his cap upon his ear,<br />
Dust-covered is his coat,<br />
By his knee the pistols hang<br />
And nigh the ground his sword.<br />
<br />
The faithful steed, rein not feeling<br />
Is walking slowly on,<br />
(Long its mane is, and is waving)<br />
Ever further it keeps on.<br />
<br />
Now before him two&mdash;three huts:<br />
Broken is the fence;<br />
To the village here the road,<br />
To the forest there.<br />
<br />
"Not in forest maid is found,"<br />
Dennis thinks, the brave.<br />
"To their chambers went the maids;<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>Are gone for the night."<br />
<br />
The son of Don he pulls the rein<br />
And the spur he strikes:<br />
Like an arrow rushed the steed&mdash;<br />
To the huts he turned.<br />
<br />
In the clouds the distant sky<br />
Was silvering the moon;<br />
A Beauty-Maid in melancholy<br />
By the window sits.<br />
<br />
Espies the brave the Beauty-Maid,<br />
Beats his heart within:<br />
Gently steed to left, to left&mdash;<br />
Under the window now is he.<br />
<br />
"Darker growing is the night<br />
And hidden is the moon;<br />
Quick, my darling, do come out,<br />
Water give my steed."<br />
<br />
"No, not unto a man so young;<br />
Right fearful't is to go;<br />
Fearful't is my house to leave,<br />
And water give thy steed."<br />
<br />
"Have no fear, O Beauty-Maid,<br />
And friendship close with me"&mdash;<br />
"Brings danger night to Beauty-Maids,"<br />

"Trust me, dear, thy fear is vain,<br />
Away with terror groundless!<br />
Time thou losest precious,<br />
Fear not, O my darling!<br />
<br />
Mount my steed; with thee I will<br />
To distant regions gallop;<br />
Blest with me be thou shalt,<br />
Heaven with mate is everywhere."<br />
<br />
And the maid? Over she bends,<br />
Her fear is overcome,<br />
Bashfully to ride consents,<br />
And the Cossak happy is.<br />
<br />
Off they dart, away they fly;<br />
Are loving one another.<br />

Forsook her on the third.<br />

"Papa, papa, oh, our nets<br />
Out a corpse have dragged."<br />
"Ye lie, ye lie, ye little devils"<br />
Upon them father grumbled.<br />
"I declare, those wicked brats!<br />
Corpse now too have they must!<br />
<br />
"Down will come the court, 'Give answer!'<br />
And for an age no rest from it.<br />
But what to do? Heigh, wife, there,<br />
My coat give me, must get there somehow....<br />
Now where's the corpse?"&mdash;"Here, papa, here!"<br />
And in truth along the river,<br />
Where is spread the moistened net,<br />
Upon the sand is seen the corpse.<br />
<br />
Disfigured terribly the corpse is,<br />
Is blue, and all is swollen.<br />
Is it a hapless sorrower,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>Who ruined has his sinful soul,<br />
Or by the waves a fisher taken,<br />
Or some fellow, drunkard,<br />
Or by robbers stripped, perchance,<br />
Trader some, unbusinesslike?<br />
<br />
To the peasant, what is this?<br />
About he looks and hastens....<br />
Seizes he the body drowned,<br />
By the feet to water drags it,<br />
And from the shore the winding<br />
Off he pushes it with oar<br />
Downward 'gain floats the corpse,<br />
And grave, and cross still is seeking.<br />
<br />
And long the dead among the waves,<br />
As if living, swinging, floated;<br />
With his eyes the peasant him<br />
Homeward going, followed.<br />
"Ye little dogs, now follow me,<br />
Each of you a cake shall have;<br />
But look ye out, and hold your tongues!<br />
Else a thrashing shall ye have."<br />
<br />
At night the wind to blow began<br />
Full of waves became the river;<br />
Out the light was already going<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>In the peasant's smoky hut.<br />
The children sleep; the mother slumbers.<br />
On the oven husband lies.<br />
Howls the storm; a sudden knocking<br />
He hears of some one at the window.<br />
<br />
"Who's there?"&mdash;"Ope the door I say!"<br />
"Time eno'; what is the matter?<br />
Wherefore comes tramp at night?<br />
By the devil art hither brought!<br />
Wherefore with you should I bother?<br />
Crowded my house and dark is."<br />
So saying, he with lazy hand<br />
Open throws the window.<br />
<br />
Rolls the moon from behind the clouds&mdash;<br />
And now? A naked man before him stands;<br />
From his beard a stream is flowing<br />
His glance is fixed, and is open.<br />
All about him is frightful dumbness<br />
And his hands are dropped down;<br />
And to the puffed-out, swollen body<br />
Black crabs are fastened.<br />
<br />
The peasant quickly shuts the window;<br />
He recognized his naked guest,<br />
Is terror-struck. "May you burst!"<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>Out he whispered and trembled.<br />
In great confusion now his thoughts are,<br />
And all night he shakes in fever;<br />
And till the morrow still the knocking<br />
'S heard on the window and at the gates.<br />
<br />
Report there was among the people:<br />
Saying, since then every year<br />
Waiting is the hapless peasant<br />
For his guest on the appointed day.<br />
In the morning the weather changes<br />
And at night the storm arrives,<br />
And the dead man is ever knocking<br />
By the window, and at the gates.<br />

THE BIRDLET.<br />
<br />
I. 171.<br />
<br />
<br />
God's birdlet knows<br />
Nor care, nor toil;<br />
Nor weaves it painfully<br />
An everlasting nest.<br />
Thro' the long night on the twig it slumbers;<br />
When rises the red sun<br />
Birdie listens to the voice of God<br />
And it starts, and it sings.<br />
When Spring, Nature's Beauty,<br />
And the burning summer have passed,<br />
And the fog, and the rain,<br />
By the late fall are brought,<br />
Men are wearied, men are grieved,<br />
But birdie flies into distant lands,<br />
Into warm climes, beyond the blue sea:<br />
Flies away until the spring.<br />

THE CLOUD.<br />
<br />
IV. 95.<br />
<br />
<br />
O last cloud of the scattered storm,<br />
Alone thou sailest along the azure clear;<br />
Alone thou bringest the shadow sombre,<br />
Alone thou marrest the joyful day.<br />
<br />
Thou but recently had'st encircled the sky<br />
When sternly the lightning was winding about thee;<br />
Thou gavest forth mysterious thunder,<br />
With rain hast watered the parched earth.<br />
<br />
Enough! Hie thyself: thy time hath passed:<br />
Earth is refreshed; the storm hath fled;<br />
And the breeze, fondling the trees' leaves<br />
Forth thee chases from the quieted heavens!<br />

THE NORTH WIND.<br />
<br />
IV. 94.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why, O wrathful north wind, thou<br />
The marshy shrub dost downward bend?<br />
Why thus in the distant sky-vault<br />
Wrathfully the cloud dost chase?<br />
<br />
The black clouds but recently<br />
Had spread the whole heavens o'er,<br />
The oak on hill top but recently<br />
In beauty wondrous itself was priding.<br />
<br />
Thou hast risen, and up hast played,<br />
With terror resounded, and with splendor&mdash;<br />
And away are driven the stormy clouds;<br />
Down is hurled the mighty oak.<br />
<br />
Let now then the sun's clear face<br />
With joy henceforth ever shine,<br />
With the clouds now the zephyr play,<br />
And the bush in quiet sway.<br />

WINTER MORNING.<br />
<br />
IV. 164.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frost and sun&mdash;the day is wondrous!<br />
Thou still art slumbering, charming friend.<br />
'Tis time, O Beauty, to awaken:<br />
Ope thine eyes, now in sweetness closed,<br />
To meet the Northern Dawn of Morning<br />
Thyself a north-star do thou appear!<br />
<br />
Last night, remember, the storm scolded,<br />
And darkness floated in the clouded sky;<br />
Like a yellow, clouded spot<br />
Thro' the clouds the moon was gleaming,&mdash;<br />
And melancholy thou wert sitting&mdash;<br />
But now ... thro' the window cast a look:<br />
<br />
Stretched beneath the heavens blue<br />
Carpet-like magnificent,<br />
In the sun the snow is sparkling;<br />
Dark alone is the wood transparent,<br />
And thro' the hoar gleams green the fir,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>And under the ice the rivulet sparkles.<br />
<br />
Entire is lighted with diamond splendor<br />
Thy chamber ... with merry crackle<br />
The wood is crackling in the oven.<br />
To meditation invites the sofa.<br />
But know you? In the sleigh not order why<br />
The brownish mare to harness?<br />
<br />
Over the morning snow we gliding<br />
Trust we shall, my friend, ourselves<br />
To the speed of impatient steed;<br />
Visit we shall the fields forsaken,<br />
The woods, dense but recently,<br />
And the banks so dear to me.<br />

WINTER EVENING.<br />

IV. 166.<br />

<br />
The storm the sky with darkness covers,<br />
The snowy whirlings twisting;<br />
Like a beast wild now is howling,<br />
Like an infant now is crying;<br />
Over the aged roof now sudden<br />
In the straw it rustling is;<br />
Like a traveller now belated<br />
For entrance at our window knocking.<br />
<br />
With melancholy and with darkness<br />
Our little, aged hut is filled<br />
Why in silence then thou sittest<br />
By the window, wife old mine?<br />
Or by the howling storms art<br />
Wearied thou, O companion mine?<br />
Or perchance art slumbering,<br />
By the rustling spindle soothed?<br />
<br />
Let us drink, O kindly friend<br />
Of my poverty and youth,<br />
Away with grief,&mdash;where is the cup?<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>Joy it shall bring to our heart.<br />

THE WINTER-ROAD.<br />
<br />
IV. 161.<br />
<br />
<br />
Breaking thro' the waving fogs<br />
Forth the moon is coming,<br />
And on the gloomy acres<br />
She gloomy light is shedding.<br />
<br />
Along the wintry, cheerless road<br />
Flies the rapid troika<br />
The little bell monotonous<br />
Wearily is tinkling.<br />
<br />
A certain homefulness is heard<br />
In the driver's lengthy lays:<br />
Now light-hearted carelessness,<br />
Now low-spirited sadness.<br />
<br />
Neither light, nor a dark hut ...<br />
Only snow and silence....<br />
Striped mileposts are alone<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>The travellers who meet us.<br />
<br />
Sad I feel and weary.... On the morrow, Nina,<br />
To my beloved I returning<br />
Forget myself shall by the fire<br />
And scarce eno' at her shall gaze.<br />
<br />
Loudly of my watch the spring<br />
Its measured circle is completing<br />
And us the parter of the wearied,<br />
Midnight, not shall separate.<br />
<br />
Sad I'm, Nina; my journey's weary;<br />
Slumbering now, my driver is quiet<br />
The little bell is monotonous<br />
And darkened now is the moon's face.<br />

THE STORM-[MAID].<br />
<br />
IV. 146.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hast thou seen on the rock the maid,<br />
In robe of white above the waves,<br />
When seething in the storm dark<br />
Played the sea with its shores,&mdash;<br />
When the glare of lightning hourly<br />
With rosy glimmer her lighted up,<br />
And the wind beating and flapping<br />
Struggled with her flying robe?<br />
<br />
Beautiful's the sea in the storm dark,<br />
Glorious is the sky even without its blue<br />
But trust me: on the rock the maid<br />
Excels both wave, and sky, and storm.<br />

Have ye heard in the woods the nightly voice<br />
Of the bard of love, of the bard of his grief?<br />

The flute's sad sound and simple<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Have ye heard?</span><br />
<br />
Have ye met in the desert darkness of the forest<br />
The bard of love, the bard of his grief?<br />
Was it a track of tears, was it a smile,<br />
Or a quiet glance filled with melancholy,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">Have ye met?</span><br />
<br />
Have ye sighed, listening to the calm voice<br />
Of the bard of love, of the bard of grief?<br />
When in the woods the youth ye saw<br />
And met the glance of his dulled eyes,<br />

Bitterly groaning, jealous maid the youth was scolding;<br />

[JEALOUSY.]<br />

IV. 85.<br />
<br />
Damp day's light is quenched: damp night's darkness<br />
Stretches over the sky its leaden garment.<br />
Like a ghost, from behind the pine wood<br />
Foggy moon has risen....<br />
All brings upon my soul darkness grievous.<br />
Far, far away rises the shining moon,<br />
There the earth is filled with evening warmth<br />
There the sea moveth with luxuriant wave<br />
Under the heavens blue....<br />
Now is the time. On the hillside now she walks<br />
To the shore washed by noisy waves.<br />
There, under the billowed cliffs<br />
Alone she sits now melancholy....<br />
Alone ... none before her weeping, grieves not,<br />
Her knees none kisses in ecstasy.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Alone ... to lips of none she is yielding<br />
Her shoulders, nor moist lips, nor snow-white fingers.<br />

Die it shall like the grievous sound<br />

Upon the sheet of memory<br />
Its traces dead leave it shall<br />
Inscriptions-like of grave-yard<br />
In some foreign tongue.<br />

What is in it? Long ago forgotten<br />
In tumultuous waves and fresh<br />
To thy soul not give it shall<br />
Pure memories and tender.<br />

But on sad days, in calmness<br />
Do pronounce it sadly;<br />
Say then: I do remember thee&mdash;<br />

Ye dreams, ye dreams,<br />

In darkness deep<br />

Round my bed<br />

At once are cooled,<br />
At once are fled,<br />
All in a crowd<br />

Still with longing<br />
The soul is filled<br />

O Love, O Love,<br />

Happy who to himself confess<br />
His passion dares without terror;<br />
Happy who in fate uncertain<br />

And with faithful key who gently<br />
The door unlocks of his beloved.<br />
<br />
But for me in sad my life<br />
No joy there is of secret pleasure;<br />
Hope's early flower faded is,<br />
By struggle withered is life's flower.<br />
Youth away flies melancholy,<br />
And droop with me life's roses;<br />
But by Love tho' long forgot,<br />
Forget Love's tears I cannot.<br />

But if thou thyself, to tenderness yielding<br />
Repeated in quiet my melancholy verses<br />
And didst love my heart's passionate language;<br />
But if I am loved:&mdash;grant then, O dearest friend,<br />
That my beautiful beloved's coveted name<br />
Breathe life into my lyre's farewell.<br />
When for aye embraced I am by sleep of Death,<br />
Over my urn do with tenderness pronounce:<br />

Of his love and song his last inspiration."<br />

Good-bye, love-letter, good-bye! 'T is her command....<br />
How long I waited, how long my hand<br />

But eno', the hour has come: burn, letter of my love!<br />
I am ready: listens more my soul to nought.<br />
Now the greedy flame thy sheets shall lick ...<br />
A minute! ... they crackle, they blaze ... a light smoke<br />
Curls and is lost with prayer mine.<br />
Now the finger's faithful imprint losing<br />
Burns the melted wax.... O Heavens!<br />
Done it is! curled in are the dark sheets;<br />
Upon their ashes light the lines adored<br />
Are gleaming.... My breast is heavy. Ashes dear,<br />
In my sorrowful lot but poor consolation,<br />
Remain for aye with me on my weary breast....<br />

A PRESENTIMENT.<br />

IV. 97.<br />

<br />
The clouds again are o'er me,<br />
Have gathered in the stillness;<br />
Again me with misfortune<br />
Envious fate now threatens.<br />
Will I keep my defiance?<br />
Will I bring against her<br />
The firmness and patience<br />
Of my youthful pride?<br />
<br />
Wearied by a stormy life<br />
I await the storm fretless<br />
Perhaps once more safe again<br />
A harbor shall I find....<br />
But I feel the parting nigh,<br />
Unavoidable, fearful hour,<br />
To press thy hand for the last time<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>I haste to thee, my angel.<br />
<br />
Angel gentle, angel calm,<br />
Gently tell me: fare thee well.<br />
Be thou grieved: thy tender gaze<br />
Either drop or to me raise.<br />
The memory of thee now shall<br />
To my soul replace<br />
The strength, the pride and the hope,<br />
The daring of my former days!<br />

In vain, dear friend, to conceal I tried<br />
The turmoil cold of my grieving soul;<br />

For the shores of thy distant home<br />
Thou hast forsaken the foreign land;<br />
In a memorable, sad hour<br />
I before thee cried long.<br />
Tho' cold my hands were growing<br />
Thee back to hold they tried;<br />
And begged of thee my parting groan<br />
The gnawing weariness not to break.<br />
<br />
But from my bitter kisses thou<br />
Thy lips away hast torn;<br />
From the land of exile dreary<br />
Calling me to another land.<br />
Thou saidst: on the day of meeting<br />
Beneath a sky forever blue<br />
Olives' shade beneath, love's kisses<br />
Again, my friend, we shall unite.<br />
<br />
But where, alas! the vaults of sky<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>Shining are with glimmer blue,<br />
Where 'neath the rocks the waters slumber&mdash;<br />

In the urnal grave have disappeared&mdash;<br />

Come hither, come hither, my friend, to me!<br />

Appear, O shade of my beloved<br />
As thou before our parting wert:<br />
Pale, cold, like a wintry day<br />
Disfigured by thy struggle of death,<br />
Come like unto a distant star,<br />
Or like a fearful apparition,<br />
'T is all the same: Come hither, come hither<br />
<br />
And I call thee, not in order<br />
To reproach him whose wickedness<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>My friend hath slain.<br />

Dark my path. Toil and pain promised are me<br />
By the Future's roughened sea.<br />

But not Death, O friends, I wish!<br />
But Life I wish: to think and suffer;<br />
Well I know, for me are joys in store<br />
'Mid struggles, toils, and sorrows:<br />

And tears I'll shed over Fancy's fruit,&mdash;<br />

Ask not why with sad reflection<br />

Ask not why with frigid soul<br />
I joyous love no longer crave,<br />
And longer none I call dear:<br />
Who once has loved, not again can love;<br />
Who bliss has known, ne'er again shall know;<br />
For one brief moment to us 't is given:<br />
Of youth, of joy, of tenderness<br />
Is left alone the sadness.<br />

Dear my friend, we are now parted,<br />
My soul's asleep; I grieve in silence.<br />
Gleams the day behind the mountain blue,<br />
Or rises the night with moon autumnal,&mdash;<br />
Still thee I seek, my far off friend,<br />
Thee alone remember I everywhere,<br />
Thee alone in restless sleep I see.<br />
Pauses my mind, unwittingly thee I call;<br />
Listens mine ear, then thy voice I hear.<br />
<br />
And thou my lyre, my despair dost share,<br />
Of sick my soul companion thou!<br />
Hollow is and sad the sound of thy string,<br />
Grief's sound alone hast not forgot....<br />
Faithful lyre, with me grieve thou!<br />
Let thine easy note and careless<br />
Sing of love mine and despair,<br />
And while listening to thy singing<br />
May thoughtfully the maidens sigh!<br />

Slowly my days are dragging<br />
And in my faded heart each moment doubles<br />
All the sorrows of hopeless love<br />
And heavy craze upsets me.<br />
But I am silent. Heard not is my murmur.<br />
Tears I shed ... they are my consolation;<br />
My soul in sorrow steeped<br />
Finds enjoyment bitter in them.<br />
O flee, life's dream, thee not regret I!<br />
In darkness vanish, empty vision!<br />
Dear to me is of love my pain,<br />
Let me die, but let me die still loving!<br />

'Mid tumults of noiseful bustle,<br />
Rang long to me thy tender voice,<br />
Came dreams to me of thy lovely features.<br />
<br />
Went by the years. The storm's rebellious rush<br />
The former dreams had scattered<br />
And I forgot thy tender voice,<br />
I forgot thy heavenly features.<br />
<br />
In the desert, in prison's darkness,<br />
Quietly my days were dragging;<br />
No reverence, nor inspiration,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>Nor tears, nor life, nor love.<br />

But at last awakes my soul:<br />

In silent gardens, in the spring, in the darkness of the night<br />
Sings above the rose from the east the nightingale;<br />

But under its lover's hymn waveth it and slumbers.<br />
<br />
Dost thou not sing thus to beauty cold?<br />
Reflect, O bard, whither art thou striding?<br />
She neither listens, nor the bard she feels.<br />
Thou gazest? Bloom she does; thou callest?&mdash;<br />

THE FLOWERET.<br />

A floweret, withered, odorless<br />
In a book forgot I find;<br />
And already strange reflection<br />
Cometh into my mind.<br />

Bloomed, where? when? In what spring?<br />
And how long ago? And plucked by whom?<br />
Was it by a strange hand? Was it by a dear hand?<br />
And wherefore left thus here?<br />
<br />
Was it in memory of a tender meeting?<br />
Was it in memory of a fated parting?<br />
Was it in memory of a lonely walk?<br />
In the peaceful fields or in the shady woods?<br />
<br />
Lives he still? Lives she still?<br />
And where their nook this very day?<br />
Or are they too withered<br />
Like unto this unknown floweret?<br />

THE HORSE.<br />
<br />
IV. 271.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why dost thou neigh, O spirited steed,<br />
Why thy neck so low,<br />
Why thy mane unshaken<br />
Why thy bit not gnawed?<br />
Do I then not fondle thee?<br />
Thy grain to eat art thou not free?<br />
Is not thy harness ornamented,<br />
Is not thy rein of silk,<br />
Is not thy shoe of silver,<br />
Thy stirrup not of gold?<br />
<br />
The steed in sorrow answer gives:<br />
Hence am I quiet<br />
Because the distant tramp I hear,<br />
The trumpet's blow and the arrow's whizz<br />
And hence I neigh, since in the field<br />
No longer feed I shall,<br />
Nor in beauty live and fondling,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>Neither shine with harness bright.<br />
<br />
For soon the stern enemy<br />
My harness whole shall take<br />
And the shoes of silver<br />
Tear he shall from feet mine light.<br />
Hence it is that grieves my spirit:<br />
That in place of my chaprak<br />
With thy skin shall cover he<br />
My perspiring sides.<br />

THE POET.<br />

(IV. 2).<br />
<br />
<br />
Ere the poet summoned is<br />
To Apollo's holy sacrifice<br />
In the world's empty cares<br />
Engrossed is half-hearted he.<br />
<br />
His holy lyre silent is<br />
And cold sleep his soul locks in;<br />
And of the world's puny children,<br />
Of all puniest perhaps is he.<br />
<br />
Yet no sooner the heavenly word<br />
His keen ear hath reached,<br />
Than up trembles the singer's soul<br />
Like unto an awakened eagle.<br />
<br />
The world's pastimes him now weary<br />
And mortals' gossip now he shuns<br />
To the feet of popular idol<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>His lofty head bends not he.<br />

<br />
Poet, not popular applause shalt thou prize!<br />
Of raptured praise shall pass the momentary noise;<br />
The fool's judgment hear thou shalt, and the cold mob's laughter&mdash;<br />
Calm stand, and firm be, and&mdash;sober!<br />
<br />
Thou art king: live alone. On the free road<br />
Walk, whither draws thee thy spirit free:<br />
Ever the fruits of beloved thoughts ripening,<br />
Never reward for noble deeds demanding.<br />
<br />
In thyself reward seek. Thine own highest court thou art;<br />
Severest judge, thine own works canst measure.<br />
Art thou content, O fastidious craftsman?<br />
Content? Then let the mob scold,<br />
And spit upon the altar, where blazes thy fire.<br />

THE THREE SPRINGS.<br />

In the world's desert, sombre and shoreless<br />
Mysteriously three springs have broken thro':<br />
Of youth the spring, a boisterous spring and rapid;<br />
It boils, it runs, it sparkles, and it murmurs.<br />
The Castalian Spring, with wave of inspiration<br />
In the world's deserts its exiles waters;<br />
The last spring&mdash;the cold spring of forgetfulness,<br />
Of all sweetest, quench it does the heart's fire.<br />

<br />
Whether I roam along the noisy streets<br />
Whether I enter the peopled temple,<br />
Whether I sit by thoughtless youth,<br />
Haunt my thoughts me everywhere.<br />
<br />
I say, Swiftly go the years by:<br />
However great our number now,<br />
Must all descend the eternal vaults,&mdash;<br />
Already struck has some one's hour.<br />
<br />
And if I gaze upon the lonely oak<br />
I think: the patriarch of the woods<br />
Will survive my passing age<br />
As he survived my father's age.<br />
<br />
And if a tender babe I fondle<br />
Already I mutter, Fare thee well!<br />
I yield my place to thee. For me<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>'T is time to decay, to bloom for thee<br />
<br />
Every year thus, every day<br />
With death my thought I join<br />
Of coming death the day<br />
I seek among them to divine.<br />
<br />
Where will Fortune send me death?<br />
In battle? In wanderings, or on the waves<br />
Or shall the valley neighboring<br />
Receive my chilled dust?<br />
<br />
But tho' the unfeeling body<br />
Can everywhere alike decay,<br />
Still I, my birthland nigh<br />
Would have my body lie.<br />
<br />
Let near the entrance to my grave<br />
Cheerful youth be in play engaged,<br />
And let indifferent creation<br />
With beauty shine there eternally.<br />

<h3>Notes.</h3>


<p><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MY PEDIGREE</span>. (<a href="#Page_61">Page 61</a>.)</p>

<p>These lines owe their origin to a public attack on Pushkin by Bulgarin,
a literary magnate of those days. Bulgarin disliked Pushkin and,
therefore, saw no merit in his poetry. But unable to argue against his
poetry, he argued against Pushkin's person, and abused the poet for
his fondness to refer to his ancient ancestry. Stung to the quick by
a childish paragraph in Bulgarin's organ, "The Northern Bee," Pushkin
wrote these lines. But on their publication which, I think, took place
some time after they were written, though they went into circulation
immediately, they made much bad blood. The Menshchikofs did not like to
be reminded of the cakes their ancestor sold, nor the Rasumofskys of
the fact that their countship was earned by the good voice of the first
of that name. And the Kutaissoffs did not like to be told that Count
Kutaissoff was originally Paul's shoe-black. The very pride in his
ancestors, which made Pushkin ridiculous in the eyes of his enemies,
made him forget the fact that selling cakes and blacking shoes, even
though they be an emperor's, is by no means a thing to be ashamed of;
and that, even if it were a thing to be ashamed of, the descendants
of evil-doers are by no means responsible for the deeds of their
ancestors.... The poem, therefore, is an excellent document, not only
for the history of the nobility of Russia, but also for that of poor
Pushkin's soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Nobleman by cross.</i> There are two kinds of noblemen in Russia: those
who inherit their title, and those who acquire it. Whoever attains a
certain cross as a reward for his service under the government (not,
alas, <i>the</i> cross of true nobility, Christ's cross!) becomes thereby a
"nobleman."</p>

<p><i>Our nobility but recent is: the more recent it, the nobler 't is.</i>
This was written fifty years ago, and thousands of miles away from
here. But one would almost believe these lines written in our day, and
at no great distance from Commonwealth Avenue,&mdash;so true is it that man
remains, after all, the same in all climes, at all times....</p>

<p><i>Of Nizhny Novgorod the citizen plain.</i> The butcher Minin is here
meant, who, with Prince Pozharsky, delivered Moscow from the Poles just
before the Romanoffs were called to the throne.</p>

<p><i>We upon it laid our hands.</i> Six Pushkins signed this call, and two had
to lay their hand to the paper, because they could not write their own
names.</p>

<p><i>Simply Pushkin, not Moussin.</i> The Moussin-Pushkins of that day were a
very rich and influential family.</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MY MONUMENT</span>. (<a href="#Page_64">Page 64</a>.)</p>

<p>In its present form, this poem did not appear till 1881. After
Pushkin's death it appeared only when altered by Zhukofsky in several
places. The Alexander Column being the tallest monument in Russia,
Pushkin, writing for Russians, used that as an illustration; but the
government could not let the sacrilege pass,&mdash;of a <i>poet's</i> monument
ever being taller, even figuratively, than a Russian emperor's. In
1837, therefore, the poet was made to say, "Napoleon's column." The
line in the fourth stanza, which speaks of Freedom, was altered
to "That I was useful by the living charm of verse," and in this
mutilated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> form this stanza is engraved on the poet's monument in
Moscow, unveiled in 1880.</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MY MUSE</span>. (<a href="#Page_66">Page 66</a>.)</p>

<p>I originally passed over this poem as unworthy of translation, because
I thought it not universal enough; because it seemed to me to express
not the human heart, but the individual heart,&mdash;Pushkin's heart. But
the great Byelinsky taught me better. He quotes these lines as a marvel
of classic, of Greek art. "See," he exclaims, "the Hellenic, the
artistic manner (and this is saying the same thing) in which Pushkin
has told us of his call, heard by him even in the days of his youth.
Yes, maugre the happy attempts of Batushkof in this direction before
Pushkin's day, <i>such</i> verses had not been seen till Pushkin in the
Russian land!" And Byelinsky is right. He <i>saw.</i> The great critic is
thus an eye-opener, because he sees his author, and because seeing
him he cannot help loving him. For if men truly <i>knew</i> one another
(assuming them to be unselfish), they would love one another.... A
hater is blind though he sees; a lover sees though he be blind. See,
also, about this piece, Introduction, § 4.</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">MY DEMON</span>. (<a href="#Page_67">Page 67</a>.)</p>

<p>To this poem Pushkin added a note, which he intended to send to
the periodical press, as if it were the comment of a third person.
Referring to the report that the poet had a friend of his in mind
when he wrote this poem, and used Rayefsky as a model, he says: "It
seems to me those who believe this report are in error; at least, I
see in 'The Demon' a higher aim, a moral aim. Perhaps the bard wished
to typify Doubt. In life's best period, the heart? not as yet chilled
by experience, is open to everything beautiful. It then is trustful
and tender. But by-and-by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> the eternal contradictions of reality give
birth to doubt in the heart; this feeling is indeed agonizing, but it
lasts not long.... It disappears, but it carries away with it our best
and poetic prejudices of the spirit." [<i>Are</i> they best, if they <i>are</i>
prejudices? <i>Is</i> illusion truly poetic?&mdash;I. P.] Not, therefore, in
vain has Goethe the Great given the name the Spirit of Denial to man's
eternal enemy. And Pushkin wished to typify the Spirit of Denial.</p>

<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE BIRDLET</span>. (<a href="#Page_97">Page 97</a>.)</p>

<p>This piece is not found among Pushkin's Lyrical Poems. It is a song
taken from a longer Narrative Poem, called "The Gypsies."</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">LOVE</span>. (<a href="#Page_113">Page 113</a>.)</p>

<p>This poem is Pushkin all over. In four lines he has given a whole
drama with a world of pathos and tenderness in it. These four lines
give more instruction in the art of story-telling than volumes on the
"Art of Fiction." A magazine writer, who of the same incidents would
have woven out some twenty pages (of which no fewer than nineteen and
three-quarters would have been writ for the approval of check-book
critic, rather than of the art critic), would have really <i>told</i> less
than Pushkin has here told,&mdash;so true is the preacher's criticism on his
own sermon: "Madame, if it had been shorter by half, it would have been
twice as long!"</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">JEALOUSY</span>. (<a href="#Page_114">Page 114</a>.)</p>

<p>Of this piece I have already spoken in the Preface, § 7.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">IN AN ALBUM</span>. (<a href="#Page_116">Page 116</a>.)</p>

<p>This is an excellent example of Pushkin's <i>sentiment</i>, of which I spoke
in the Introduction, Chapter III. It is all the more entitled to the
consideration of Anglo-Saxon <i>a priori</i> sentiment-haters (it is so easy
to keep to <i>a priori</i> judgments, they are so convenient; they save
discussion!) because Pushkin wrote this piece when fully matured, at
the age of thirty, when his severe classic taste was already formed.</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FIRST LOVE</span>. (<a href="#Page_120">Page 120</a>.)</p>

<p>These lines are taken from the Narrative Poem, "The Prisoner of the
Caucasus."</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">SIGNS</span>. (<a href="#Page_124">Page 124</a>.)</p>

<p>Of the more-than-Egyptian number of plagues with which poor Pushkin's
soul was afflicted, superstition was one. He believed in signs, and
sometimes gave up a journey when a hare ran across his road. Owing
to this superstition he once gave up a trip to St. Petersburg, which
probably would have cost him his life, had he made it. For on hearing
of the December rebellion, in which many of his friends took part, he
started for the capital, but the hare....</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">ELEGY</span>. (<a href="#Page_132">Page 132</a>.)</p>

<p>The fourth volume of Pushkin's Works, in which this poem was first
published, struck Byelinsky with the poverty of its contents. "But in
the fourth volume of Pushkin's Poems," says he, "there is one precious
pearl which reminds us of the song of yore, of the bard of yore. It is
the elegy, 'The extinguished joy of crazy years.' Yes!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> such an elegy
can redeem not only a few tales, but even the entire volume of poetry!"
... (Byelinsky's Works, ii. 194.)</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">LOVE AND FREEDOM</span>. (<a href="#Page_137">Page 137</a>.)</p>

<p>In the original this poem is called, "To Countess N. V. Kotshubey."</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">INSPIRING LOVE</span>. (<a href="#Page_139">Page 139</a>.)</p>

<p>In the original this piece is headed, "To A. P. Kern."</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE GRACES</span>. (<a href="#Page_141">Page 141</a>.)</p>

<p>Addressed to Princess S. A. Urussov.</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">TO THE POET</span>. (<a href="#Page_153">Page 153</a>.)</p>

<p>This is the only poem Turgenef quotes in his speech at the unveiling of
the Pushkin monument in 1880. "Of course," he said, "you all know it,
but I cannot withstand the temptation to adorn my slim, meagre prosy
speech with this poetic gold."</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">THE TASK</span>. (<a href="#Page_155">Page 155</a>.)</p>

<p>Byelinsky, who has taught me to appreciate much in Pushkin which I
otherwise would not have appreciated, speaks of this little piece as
"especially excellent" among Pushkin's anthological poems, written
in hexameter, and says, that a breath antique blows from them. Well,
I cannot agree with Byelinsky. There is, doubtless, a <i>sentimentlet</i>
in the piece,&mdash;a germ; but it is only a germ, incomplete, immature. I
would not have translated it (since its beauty, whatever that be, it
owes entirely to its form, which is untranslatable), but for the sake
of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> reader, in justice to whom, a poem so highly thought of by
Byelinsky ought to be given, whatever my opinion of it.</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">QUESTIONINGS</span>. (<a href="#Page_157">Page 157</a>.)</p>

<p>In the original this piece is headed, "26 May, 1828."</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">FAME</span>. (<a href="#Page_160">Page 160</a>.)</p>

<p>The first cantos of Eugene Onyegin were issued with the "Dialogue
between the Bookseller and the Poet" as a preface. This poem is one of
the arguments of the poet in the dialogue; and, as it is an independent
song in itself, I have not hesitated to treat it as such.</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">HOME-SICKNESS</span>. (<a href="#Page_162">Page 162</a>.)</p>

<p>In the original these lines are entitled, "To P. A. Ossipova."</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">DEATH-THOUGHTS</span>. (<a href="#Page_165">Page 165</a>.)</p>

<p>In the original this poem is headed, "Stanzas."</p>



<p class="p2"><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">RIGHTS</span>. (<a href="#Page_167">Page 167</a>.)</p>

<p>In the original this is called, "From VI. Pindemonte." But this is
an original piece by Pushkin; at first he called it, "From Alfred
Musset." Evidently the censorship was likely to pass it as a work of a
foreign author where it would not as one of Pushkin; to his political
convictions Pushkin never, indeed, did dare to give free expression. He
never deliberately misled the government, but he did at times lead it
to believe more in his loyalty than was strictly in accordance with the
facts.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
